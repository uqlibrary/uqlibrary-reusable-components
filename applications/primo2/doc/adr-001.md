## Title

Generate the branch to call polymer reusable form in primo rather than hard coding it

## Context

The UQ purple header is included in primo through include files like `assets.library.uq.edu.au/primo-sand-box/reusable-components/`, via the primo BO.

Up until now we have been hard coding the primo-sand-box bit according to which environment we are in, and having to remember to manually change it depending on which environment we were uploading to.

Manual processes are to be avoided.

## Decision

Generate the branch to be used, by looking at the host name and the vid parameter on the url

## Status

Accepted

## Consequences

If we change the host (unlikely) or we change the vid values (or completely put the vid in the url differently) (conceivable) then the includes will stop working until we tweak it, and this code is why.

This wont affect blue OTB, as it doesnâ€™t pull our js at all.

Custom views, such as 61UQ_DAC, will still get its current primo_sand_box branch, because it will match vid=61UQ.
